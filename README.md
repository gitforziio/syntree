#### Forked

Forked from https://github.com/mshang/syntree .

The original project's canvas has been replaced with SVG, resulting in higher definition.

#### Origin ReadMe

The goal of this project is to create a browser-based, fully local syntax tree generator, for drawing trees as you might find in an introductory linguistics course. Here are a few main features:

* Designed to be easy to use.
* Draws as you type for real-time feedback.
* Basic support for movement arrows using markup.
* Supports Unicode insofar as the browser it is running on does.
* Adjustable appearance.
* Linkable, i.e. parses the query string.

For more details, see the [wiki](https://github.com/mshang/syntree/wiki).

The app can be found at <http://mshang.ca/syntree/>. If you publish a paper with a tree drawn by this app, I would appreciate it if you sent me a link to your paper.
